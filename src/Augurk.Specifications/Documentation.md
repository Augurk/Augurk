# Augurk Documentation

On here we describe the functionality of Augurk itself. What you are looking at right now is called a product page.
It allows you to give each product for which you upload feature files to Augurk an introduction. For example, you could
use it to describe what the product is all about. Or you can provide any other information about the product that you
want to share.

In order for your product page to show up in Augurk, you will need to upload it using the command line tool. Basically,
you write a simple Markdown document and pass the path to that document to the command line tool. Since it is Markdown,
you can use the usual syntax to make things **bold** or *italic* or any of the other markup features that Markdown
provides.
