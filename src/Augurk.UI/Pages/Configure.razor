                <p>
                    When working with features, you hardly ever describe a feature that is designed to work in a vacuum. Most features are build on top of other features, or are themselves the foundation for other features. Augurk can detect these inter-feature dependencies and will display them along with the feature descriptions to help create a better understanding of the feature within its full context.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Instructions</b>: Additional data is required to analyze the dependencies within your features. This data can be collected using the Augurk Analyzers.
                    At this moment there is only a C# version available, please visit its projectpage for instructions on how to collect the data: link<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i>This feature is currently in Alpha. As of yet, there is no formal support for this feature, but any and all feedback is much appreciated.</i>

        <i>Augurk exposes several APIs to enable integration in your own tools:</i> <a href="/doc/ui/index.html?urls.primaryName=V2">Go to documentation.</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Of course, the easiest way to interact with the Augurk APIs is through the commandline tool which is available on
        <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Augurk.CLI/">NuGet</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        Users of <b>Azure DevOps (Server)</b> can also use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=augurk.augurk">Augurk extension</a>.
